# darkpixels

a python program that finds the two darkest pixels in an image and puts an "X" on top of each

what i have done:
- download homebrew
- download python conda
- check that PIL (python image library) is downloaded in the correct version
- choose an image
    - in darkpixels directory
- step1.py
    - loaded in image to do more cool stuff with!
- step2.py
    - extract all pixel values from the image and store in a list
    - print out the for loop for formatting checking 

what i still need to do:  
- step3.py
    - for loop through the list to find the two darkest pixels
    - store these two pixels in an array
    - the pixels cannot be next to each other
    - for each, replace the color of that specific pixel with red
    - as well, place the X's around each
      - in the two dimensional array that the pixels are stored in, place red at the pixels around it to form an X
- celebrate!
