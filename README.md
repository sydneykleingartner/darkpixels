# darkpixels

a python program that finds the darkest pixel in an image and puts an "X" on top

my steps:
- download homebrew
- download python conda
- check that PIL (python image library) is downloaded in the correct version
- choose an image
    - in darkpixels directory
- step1.py
    - loaded in image to do more cool stuff with!
- step2.py
    - extract all pixel values from the image and store in a list
    - print out the for loop for formatting checking 
- step3.py
    - initialize variables and for loops
    - overall strategy for step 3
    - for loop through the list to find and store the darkest pixel
    - replace the color of the darkest pixel with red
    - place the red X around the darkest pixel
      - in the two dimensional array that the pixels are stored in, place red at the pixels around it to form an X
